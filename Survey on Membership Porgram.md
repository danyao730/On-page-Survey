# Survey on Website - Membership Program
According to [Test 7 - On-page survey product design](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/test-designer/blob/master/Test%207%20-%20Design%20an%20on-page%20survey%20product.md#test-7----on-page-survey-product-design), Wiredcraft is helping clients collect feedback from on-page survey in order to find out pain points and discover opportunities to improve. 

Here I scale down the scope to focus on the membership propram, and to optimize the survey experience on it.

## Membership Program
In terms of the Membership Program, we need to learn from users about the basic using status quos, and get insights from them. So that the client are able to know how to better incentive users' participation on the products and get more long-term members. 

## Our Requirement
In order to get basic information we want their basic peronas, habitat on membership and perference of card's application.

## Questionnaire
From the client side, what we should help them is to establish the basic persona of their users(age, gender, region, salary, education). What's more, as on membership program, the habitat of consuming and user's perference are quiet important. 

Before designing the questionnare, there are 4 points to follow:

  - Simple
  - Neutral
  - Fluent
  - Incentive

Based on the demo data sheet, I set up my own basic information architecture.

## Information Architecture

There are 5 major parts in the architecture: Welcome Screen, Basic Questions, Relevant Questions, Feedback, Reward Screen

  ### Screener - Welcome Screen

  In order to filter people out of the survey as less as possible, this screener page should be encouragous to arouse user's willingness to join. Rather than a normal introduction, users are more inclined to something interesting, like getting an invitation and playing an significant role. If they find themselves being invited as an Experience Officer to a survey, it would be incentive. Even better, they can also be informed to be rewarded in the end if they complete very question. 
  
  
  
  ### Persona - Basic Questions

  Before asking people direct questions about the website, basic questions (age, gender, salary...) are useful for us to build personas and find out relationship among user's identity, consuming habits, and opinions. 

  In order to not make users feel be offended on privacy, they are provided with option "Not applicable" 
  
  

  ### Program - Direct Questions

  
  As for membership program, we need to know the condition of channel and product itself. 
  
  So the structure would be :
  
  **Screener - How to make the program known better - How to motivate people's engagement**  
  
  As for the screenerm,we can ask them "Do you know about our membership program?" at first to filter user. The first way to ask is to encourage users to share their ideas about it and something related. No matter what people choose, even "NO", they will feel not being excluded. 
 
  By investigations on Netease Yanxuan (online), Starbucks and Sisyphe bookshop's membership program, the business side seems to positivly promote their program with advertisement of Membership Benifits(freeshipping, exclusive sales and meetups, etc.), coupon and gifts. We can put the assumption as our option into the survey, and see if it can be validated.
  

  ### Feedback

  The page includes "thank you" and open question about how the user feel about this survey.
  
 

  ### Reward

  For those who finish the survey completely, they can be awarded in the end.

### Wireframe

Here is the wireframe and basic interaction file: https://www.figma.com/file/Yzx6KEvuIwW4Qf9OdTs0Erei/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

  #### Pick and Proceed

  Rather than to make user pick the option and then click "Next" button, to proceed once the user select can shorten the consuming time, which will reduce people's anxiety for wasting time.

  #### Progress Bar

  Besides the survey, a progress bar is necessary to inform users about how long it would take to complete this survey, or the number of questions left to keep them informed and also slightly reduce the chances of dropping off.

  #### card-like button

  Providing users with card-like button with option text on it can make the interface concise and easy to read, and then facilitate users' making choices.
